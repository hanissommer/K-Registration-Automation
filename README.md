# KregisterBot
This is a python program that asks the user for their K credentials and logs into Hornet HQ and attempts to register for courses.

This program will allow for users to not have to manually register for classes but instead use this program to automate the process.

Note: The program runs on Chrome browser only

> To start, click the 'Code' button, select 'Download ZIP' , and chose your downloads folder as the download path

> Unzip the folder and paste the unzipped folder in the same 'Downloads' folder

> Navigate: >KregisterBot-master>dist>main>main.exe

> A terminal should open as well as a Chrome browser window with HornetHQ. 

> In the terminal, you will be prompted to Copy path for chrome driver. It should be something like: "C:\Users\*your_name*\KregisterBot-master\KregisterBot-master"

> In the terminal, you will be prompted to enter your K ID and password. Hit enter after typing in each.

> The program should now log you in and navigate to the page on which you register.

> Here, it will attempt to click the 'Register Now' button and if it is not available to be clicked, it will refresh the page and try again.

> The program will do this continually until that button is clickable and is clicked, meaning that you've successfully registered.
